# Getting Started - Instructions:

* Download your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=18830">facebook information</a>
5
* Download and unpack the <a href="https://github.com/carmi/facebook-analyzer/tarball/master">Facebook Analyzer package</a> in the same directory as your downloaded facebook information. The <code>index.html</code> file from the downloaded facebbok information files should be in the same directory as the Facebook Analyzer package's <code>fb_parser.py</code> file.
